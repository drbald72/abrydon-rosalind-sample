# Andrew Brydon's Sample Rosalind Code 

This is a small sampling of solutions generated for [project rosalind](http://rosalind.info) using java 8. As well as refreshing some of my bioinformatics skills, it was an opportunity to try out at least some new java 8 features. 

Project rosalind presents each of the problem with a problem code, such as GC, DNA or Cons. The main programs in the `org.abrydon.javabio.rosalind.driver` package produces simple text solutions based on the corresponding resource files supplied by the site.
